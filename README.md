BeXlib
===========================
From the [original SourceForgeJP homepage](http://sourceforge.jp/projects/bexlib/): "The project is a wrapper around Xlib for BeOS. I wanted to be able to make it easier to port X11 apps to BeOS." It was written by Shibukawa Yoshiki ("ja6hfa") and "kazuyakt".

It's quite incomplete.
