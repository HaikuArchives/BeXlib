XBeLib
===========================
(a lot of info here may be partly, wrong, it came through Google Translate.)

From the [original SourceForgeJP homepage](http://sourceforge.jp/projects/bexlib/): "The project is a wrapper around Xlib for BeOS. I wanted to be able to make it easier to port X11 apps to BeOS." It was written by Shibukawa Yoshiki ("ja6hfa") and "kazuyakt".

It's quite incomplete, and requires a copy of X11 (TODO: use this as a submodule). For the future, it would be good to drop this requirement.
